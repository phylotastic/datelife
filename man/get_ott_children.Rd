\title{use this instead of rotl::tol_subtree when taxa are not in synthesis tree and you still need to get all species or an induced otol subtree}
\usage{
get_ott_children(input = NULL, ott_ids = NULL, ott_rank = "species")
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{Optional. A character vector of names or a datelifeQuery object}

\item{ott_ids}{Optional. A numeric vector of ott ids obtained with rotl::taxonomy_taxon_info or rolt::tnrs_match_names or datelife::tnrs_match}

\item{ott_rank}{A character vector with the ranks you wanna get lineage children from.}
}

use this instead of rotl::tol_subtree when taxa are not in synthesis tree and you still need to get all species or an induced otol subtree

\examples{
# try getting an otol tree of a taxon missing from the synthetic tree
# tnrs <- rotl::tnrs_match_names("Mus")
tnrs <- tnrs_match("Canis")
# Mus, Gleicheniales, Polypodiales, etc., are missing in synth tree too
\dontrun{

# Other examples:
oo <- get_ott_children(input= "magnoliophyta", ott_rank = "order")
sum(oo$Magnoliophyta$rank == "order") # to know how many orders of flowering plants we have
