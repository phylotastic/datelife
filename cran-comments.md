❯ checking package dependencies ... NOTE
  Packages suggested but not available for checking: 'msa', 'Biostrings'

  Imports includes 22 non-default packages.
  Importing from so many packages makes the package vulnerable to any
  of them becoming unavailable.  Move as many as possible to Suggests
  and use conditionally.
